Arduino-S0PCM
=====

Arduino script for reading out a pulsing led (PCM) device (power meter in my case) with an Arduino and reporting the outcome in S0 format so that itâ€™s easy to pick up with Domoticz.

Tested on an Arduino Uno and a 38 cent photosensitive sensor module (Aliexpress, with LM393 comparator, ~40 cents)
